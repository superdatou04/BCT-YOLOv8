# BCT-YOLOv8lï¼šA knowledge distillation-based paradigm for few-shot incremental crop pest detection

A novel few-shot incremental pest detection model named BCT-YOLOv8l is developed, which maintains the accuracy of base classes while allowing effective detection of new class with limited samples. This model significantly reduces training time and detects new class while maintaining the accuracy of base classes. In particularly, it adopts Bridging Cross-task Knowledge Distillation (BCKD), Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWKD) and Teacher Adaptation (TA) strategy.
